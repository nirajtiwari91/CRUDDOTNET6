.NET 6 Introduction
Unified and extended platform
.NET 6 delivers a unified platform, for browser, cloud, desktop, IoT, and mobile apps.

Simplified development: Getting started is easy. New language features in C# 10 reduce the amount of code you need to write. And investments in the web stack and minimal APIs make it easy to quickly write smaller, faster micro services.

Better performance: .NET 6 is the fastest full stack web framework, which lowers compute costs if you're running in the cloud.

Ultimate productivity: .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022 provide hot reload, new git tooling, intelligent code editing, robust diagnostics and testing tools, and better team collaboration.
